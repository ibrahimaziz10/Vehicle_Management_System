# Vehicle_Management_System
ðŸš— Car Management System (Python OOP Project)
This project is a console-based Car Management System developed in Python to demonstrate core programming fundamentals including:

ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ðŸ“„ File Handling with JSON

ðŸ§  Encapsulation

ðŸ’¥ Exception Handling

ðŸ“‹ Menu-Driven CLI Interface

ðŸ”„ Dynamic List Management (Cars, Bikes, Customers, Staff, Bookings)

âœ… Features
User Roles: Separate functionality for Customer and Staff

Vehicle Booking:

Customers can book and return cars/bikes

View individual booking history

Vehicle Inventory:

Staff can add, update status, and remove vehicles

View all available vehicles

Customer/Staff Registration

Booking History (for both customers and staff)

Data Persistence:

All data is saved and loaded using .json files

Exception Handling:

Prevents crashes from bad user input or missing files

ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
Python Classes & Inheritance

Use of Protected Attributes

Class methods (@classmethod) for object reconstruction from JSON

File I/O using the json module

Custom data serialization with to_dict() / from_dict() methods

try/except blocks for error handling

Loop-driven menu navigation

Use of lists to mimic databases for:

Cars

Bikes

Customers

Staff

Booking records

ðŸ’¡ Purpose
This project serves as a learning showcase for mastering the fundamentals of Python programming and Object-Oriented Design. It is ideal for beginner to intermediate Python learners looking to understand how to structure a real-world application without using external frameworks or databases.
